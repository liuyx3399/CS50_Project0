                    <p>Tones and semitones:</p>
                    <p>Note that using only white notes we have identified two 'sets' of semitones. The first set is between B and C, the other set is between E and F.</p>
                    <p>These intervals can most clearly be seen on a keyboard because there is no black key between them - if you look back at the keyboard graphic you will see this.</p>
                    <p>The C major scale:</p>
                    <p>Knowing the difference between these tones (T) and semitones (S), allows us to derive the C major scale:</p>

                    <p>C is the tonic here, and this scale is an example of a <b>diatonic scale</b> - one that has a pattern of 2 semitones and 5 tones going from one octave to the next.</p>
