                    <p>When the pattern of tones and semitones is different, the scale sounds different - formally it has a different quality.</p>
                    <p>Here is an example of that different quality. This is God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, the Christmas Carol that I played on flute, (written by an unknown composer, but probably dating back to the Seventeenth Century).</p>

                    <p>If you are new to reading notation donâ€™t worry, you can still follow the notes of this tune - and notice how the melody keeps coming back to the A.</p>
                    <p>We also named the A natural minor the Aeolian mode - we will now move on to the modes. Different modes are simply found by starting our major scale on a different note- this then arithmetically rearranges the pattern of those 5 tones and 2 semitones- the following modes are all therefore also diatonic.</p>
                    <p>Here are the names as we refer to them today: The Seven Diatonic Modes (showing the patterns of tones and semitones)</p>
